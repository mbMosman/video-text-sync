00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:09,466
Hi guys, I'm Mary Mosman. I'm your instructor

2
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:13,600
for the course this semester.  I just wanted to say hello before class starts

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,700
and let you kinda see who I am. So I am one of the full time

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,666
instructors at HTC, so feel free to reach out to me if you have

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:25,466
questions about our program or different classes. Um.

6
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:29,466
prerequisites, which order you should take classes in, when they might be

7
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:33,666
offered, general things like that. In addition to, of course, if you have questions

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:42,166
about this particular class, your assignments and things that you're working on.

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,166
So my office hours are posted on the syllabus. Feel free to

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:50,166
stop in, in-person. Um. You can also do

11
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:54,166
online meetings as well, so there are some preferred times for that

12
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,166
listed in the syllabus, but as long as you set something up with me in advance, and that works

13
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:02,166
for both of our schedules, I'm pretty flexible. I do ask though that

14
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:06,166
you try to set that up with me at least a day in advance, and for the weekends

15
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,166
um make sure you set up a time with me before 5 o'clock on Friday.

16
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:16,533
So that I can know my schedule for the weekend as well.

17
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:20,533
It works pretty well to do the online appointments.  We can do a

18
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:24,533
video meeting kinda like this where we can talk through somethings.

19
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:28,533
Um or we can do a screen share session. So if

20
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:32,533
you're working on an assignment, where it's more helpful to be looking at what you're

21
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:36,533
doing, we can do that too. And kinda talk through what you're working

22
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,533
on, how it's turning out, you know if things are behaving the way you expect

23
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,533
we can kind of interactively go through that, just like if we were in-person.

24
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:48,533
So I do encourage you to take advantage of this.  I don't want

25
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:52,533
you to feel like you're alone in the course. I'm here to help you. You just need to reach out to me

26
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:58,633
and let me know that you need some help.

27
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:02,633
You can also feel free to hit me up if you have questions about, um

28
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:06,633
what it's like to actually work as a developer out there in industry.

29
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:10,633
I do have 15 years plus, really, of experience

30
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:14,633
before I started here teaching full-time, so I've worked of

31
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:18,633
companies around the Twin Cities area. Um My background is in

32
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:22,633
Web Development with Java, JavaScript,

33
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:26,633
HTML, CSS, things like that.  Of course I've worked with databases too.

34
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:30,633
So feel free, if you've got questions about what it's like to

35
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:34,633
work out there, if you wanna talk about the job market. Um. Things

36
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:38,233
like that, feel free to hit me up for questions like that as well.

37
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:42,233
You can also connect with on LinkedIn, I do have an

38
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:46,233
HTC CCIS alumni group out there. It's a pretty cool community

39
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,233
We've occasionally had Happy Hours and I post job

40
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:54,233
postings and things like that out there for the group as well. Um

41
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:58,233
It is an alumni group, so you want to hit me up to get in the group as you're about

42
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:02,233
to graduate, um, but you can certainly connect with me on

43
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:08,033
LinkedIn in the mean time as well.

44
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:12,033
So you might also here that I like to game, and that would be true.

45
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:16,033
Um Computer games mostly, but board games are cool too.

46
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:20,033
I do have a Steam group out there, so if you too like to game

47
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,033
you should let me know and I would be more than happy to add you to our Steam

48
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:28,033
group that is specifically for HTC CCIS students

49
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,033
Um I don't play so many games myself over

50
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:36,033
the semester. You guys actually keep me quite busy. But the group

51
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:40,033
is really more about getting to know other students that have similar

52
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:44,033
interests, making some new friends, and just enjoying your free time.  So

53
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:48,033
if you're interested, send me your Steam name and I would be more

54
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,199
than happy to add you to the Steam group.
